# NVSHMEM and DeepEP

GPU-to-GPU communication primitives for MoE at scale. Both designed assuming NVLink-class fabrics; both perform poorly or refuse to run on workstation Blackwell.

## NVSHMEM

NVIDIA's implementation of the OpenSHMEM standard for GPUs: **one-sided** GPU memory operations (put, get, atomic) across a partitioned global address space (PGAS).

GitHub: not public; ships with HPC SDK. License: NVIDIA proprietary.

### What it does

A typical NVSHMEM call:

```c
nvshmem_putmem(dst_ptr_on_peer, src_ptr_local, size, peer_pe);
nvshmem_signal_op(flag_ptr_on_peer, value, op, peer_pe);
nvshmem_signal_wait_until(flag_ptr_local, op, value);
```

This:

1. Initiates an asynchronous one-sided write from local GPU memory to peer GPU memory
2. Signals a flag on the peer (a remote atomic update)
3. Waits for the local flag to be signaled (busy-poll on the atomic)

Critically: the operation is **fire-and-forget from the issuing GPU's perspective** — the issuer continues immediately. Synchronization is via the signal/wait pair.

### Why MoE all-to-all uses it

In a MoE layer with expert parallelism (EP), each token must be routed to its assigned experts on (potentially) other GPUs. The dispatch is an all-to-all:

```
For each rank r:
    For each peer p:
        Send (tokens-routed-to-p) to peer p
```

The naive implementation is a stream of NCCL `send`/`recv` calls, but those are *two-sided* (both sender and receiver issue ops). NVSHMEM's one-sided model is more efficient: the sender issues all writes, the receiver just polls the completion flags. This **halves the communication overhead** in steady-state.

DeepEP, DeepSeek's expert-parallel a2a kernel, uses NVSHMEM for exactly this reason.

### SM compatibility

NVSHMEM works on any CUDA architecture in principle. The performance profile differs sharply by interconnect:

| Topology | NVSHMEM throughput |
| --- | --- |
| NVLink 5 (NVL72) | ~1.8 TB/s/GPU, latency ~1 µs |
| NVSwitch (DGX) | ~900 GB/s/GPU |
| PCIe Gen5 P2P (datacenter) | ~64 GB/s/GPU pair |
| **PCIe Gen4 P2P (consumer)** | **~32 GB/s/GPU pair, much higher latency** |

The PCIe paths exist but are an order of magnitude slower than NVLink. Worse: NVSHMEM's signal-wait depends on **P2P atomics**, which on consumer cards are software-gated off (see [`interconnect/p2p-and-atomics`](../interconnect/p2p-and-atomics.md)).

### What this means for workstation Blackwell

Even when NVSHMEM is technically available, the practical workstation-Blackwell experience is:

- **No NVLink → bandwidth is at PCIe levels (~50× slower)**
- **No P2P atomics → signal/wait deadlocks**

So NVSHMEM-based MoE all-to-all is effectively non-functional on workstation Blackwell. Workarounds: use NCCL all-to-all instead, or avoid the all-to-all by changing parallelism plan.

## DeepEP

DeepSeek's expert-parallel all-to-all kernel suite. Implements the dispatch and combine phases of MoE EP layers using NVSHMEM (intranode) and RDMA (internode).

GitHub: `deepseek-ai/DeepEP`. License: MIT.

### What it provides

Three transports:

- **Intranode**: NVSHMEM-over-NVLink, single chassis. The fast path. Targets DGX-class hardware.
- **Internode**: RDMA-over-InfiniBand or RoCE, multi-node. The scaling path. Targets datacenter clusters with RDMA NICs.
- **Hybrid-EP** (experimental): hybrid PCIe + NVSHMEM. Less mature; design intent is to work on consumer-ish topologies.

### SM compatibility (and topology compatibility)

| Configuration | DeepEP intranode | DeepEP internode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NVL72 (NVLink + MNNVL) | ✓ optimal | ✓ optimal |
| DGX H100/H200 | ✓ | ✓ via RDMA NICs |
| 8× H100 PCIe + RDMA | partial (no NVLink, must use internode) | ✓ |
| **4× workstation Blackwell, no NVLink, no RDMA** | ✗ requires NVLink | ✗ requires RDMA NIC |

For the workstation Blackwell case, **neither DeepEP transport is usable**. The hybrid-EP path is the only theoretical option; it's experimental and not validated on consumer Blackwell.

### Common failures

**On workstation Blackwell**:

- DeepEP intranode init fails because NVSHMEM detects no NVLink endpoints
- DeepEP internode init fails because no RDMA NIC is present
- Hybrid-EP path may launch but produce wrong outputs or hang

The recommended action is to **not use DeepEP at all** on workstation Blackwell, and instead replace the EP plan with a TP+PP plan that doesn't require all-to-all.

**On B200**: the upstream DeepEP README still lists Hopper only. The code has `__CUDA_ARCH__ >= 1000` branches and UE8M0 scale plumbing, so it builds; the GB200 NVL72 issue is still open, and an NVL72 domain needs Fabric Manager plus IMEX. V2 (April 2026) switched the backend to NCCL Gin. On the NVSHMEM side, 3.2.5 supports NVLink 5 on B200 and NVL72 is GA from 3.3.9.

## NCCL as the fallback

NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) provides standard collective operations: `all_reduce`, `all_gather`, `reduce_scatter`, `all_to_all`. Unlike NVSHMEM, NCCL is **two-sided** and works over any backend (NVLink, PCIe, IB, even TCP).

For MoE all-to-all on workstation Blackwell, NCCL's `all_to_all_single` is the practical implementation:

```python
torch.distributed.all_to_all_single(output, input, output_split_sizes, input_split_sizes)
```

It's slower than NVSHMEM-on-NVLink (no one-sided benefits, no SM-resident execution) but works correctly without atomics.

NCCL has its own quirks on workstation Blackwell:

- `NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=PIX` recommended (only attempt P2P at PCIe Internal Switch level; cross-root-complex transfers go through host-staging)
- `NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1` if no IB
- Watch for cross-root-complex deadlocks at TP=4 warmup; sometimes fixed by `SGLANG_PYNCCL_SKIP_WARMUP=1` (or equivalent in vLLM)

## Summary table

| Library | Topology assumption | Workstation Blackwell? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NVSHMEM | NVLink for performance + atomics for sync | broken without atomics; even with, very slow |
| DeepEP intranode | NVSHMEM + NVLink | requires NVLink |
| DeepEP internode | RDMA NIC | requires RDMA |
| DeepEP hybrid-EP | PCIe (experimental) | unproven |
| NCCL | any backend, two-sided | works correctly, slower than NVLink-NVSHMEM |
| FlashInfer one-shot a2a | atomics over P2P | broken without atomics |

**The takeaway**: every "fast" MoE all-to-all kernel currently shipping assumes either NVLink or PCIe atomics. Workstation Blackwell has neither (by default). The NCCL fallback works but eliminates most of the EP-vs-TP performance advantage.

This is why MoE inference on consumer Blackwell ends up using TP+PP instead of EP — see [`interconnect/moe-parallelism`](../interconnect/moe-parallelism.md).
